# Traffic-Simulation
DSA_PROJECT


A traffic simulation project using data structures and algorithms (DSA) involves creating an efficient system to manage the dynamic interactions of vehicles, traffic signals, and road infrastructure. The goal is to accurately model traffic flow, predict traffic conditions, and optimize traffic management.
